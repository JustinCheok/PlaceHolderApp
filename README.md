# PlaceHolder App

This is a Android application with it just being created as a fun app with different fun/entertaining games.  


## Home Screen
What I accomplished from this assignment was creating a linear feedback shift register (LFSR).
Implementing the Fibonacci method into the linear feedback register. In the assignment the
constructor took an initial input seed as a string argument which the characters in the input
sequence were filled with 0’s and 1’s. What was also created was a step function. This function
was used to simulate one step/ iteration through the linear feedback shift register and returned the
right most bit as an 0 or 1. For this first part it was tested using unit tests from Boost test
frameworks. For the second part of this assignment it implements what we’ve made and we
created a transform function which takes an image and an Fibonacci linear feedback shift register
as its arguments. And then transforms the input image by the pixel.

## Lights Out  
The key algorithm used was a mix of sorting and binary searching. This assignment uses sorting
because the linear feedback shift register uses a function created called step. And this function
simulates one step of the LFSR and returns the rightmost bit as an integer, which being a 0 or 1.

## Hangman 
This assignment used a sorting structure. Which is relatively similar to a queue data structure
method. In a queue it uses a method first in, first out, but in this it was a sorting method which
took an initial seed and moved it along the linear feedback shift register.

## Minesweeper 
This assignment used a sorting structure. Which is relatively similar to a queue data structure
method. In a queue it uses a method first in, first out, but in this it was a sorting method which
took an initial seed and moved it along the linear feedback shift register.
